![*☆*](https://xaoiui.neocities.org/Limestar.gif) Since it is almost christmas (two days as of writing) I thought I should make something christmasy. ![*☆*](https://xaoiui.neocities.org/Limestar.gif)

![*☆*](https://xaoiui.neocities.org/Limestar.gif) It outputs the twelve days of christmas song, but with a programmy twist! ![*☆*](https://xaoiui.neocities.org/Limestar.gif)

# How does it work?
![*☆*](https://xaoiui.neocities.org/Limestar.gif) When run the program gets the date and figures out how far it is from Christmas, and then saves that to a variable. ![*☆*](https://xaoiui.neocities.org/Limestar.gif)

![*☆*](https://xaoiui.neocities.org/Limestar.gif) After it gets the date it subtracts the day from 25 and then uses that value in a for loop that repeats until the sum of the variable and the index is 12. ![*☆*](https://xaoiui.neocities.org/Limestar.gif)

![*☆*](https://xaoiui.neocities.org/Limestar.gif) If you run this more than twelve days away from christmas it will close!! ![*☆*](https://xaoiui.neocities.org/Limestar.gif)
